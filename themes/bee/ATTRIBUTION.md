# Bee's Theme

Bee's Theme shares the direct JL renderer in `../jl/theme.js` and keeps JL's
colours, typography, repeated dictionary headers, frequencies and pitch marker.
See [JL's attribution](../jl/ATTRIBUTION.md) and [Apache-2.0 licence](../jl/LICENSE.Apache-2.0).

The additions are group-only tabs, expandable rich dictionary content, the shared
Hachidori personal dictionary editor and custom link/Anki buttons. Rich content
uses Hachidori's existing structured glossary renderer. The theme never builds
Default's popup. Hachidori integration is GPL-3.0-or-later.

The host supplies `createLookupActions` and `createDictionaryTabs` components,
plus its existing `appendTextOnlyGlossary` callback, and loads scoped dictionary
styles. Without configured groups with matching results, all definitions appear
without a tab row. Custom actions beyond the first two appear in More actions.
Rich DOM and images are created only when Formatted definition is opened.
